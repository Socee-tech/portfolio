 This portfolio is made up of the first page where it gives details about my self (educational background, some of my experiences and the level of my studies.)
 I have attached my CV which you can wish to view or to download.
 Also with it i have attached two clickable buttons that directs you to different projects i have developed using HTML and CSS only.
 I have also attached links to my github account and linked in.
 i have also provided my contacts where any one wishing to contact me can freely do so.
